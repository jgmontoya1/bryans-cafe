        <h2>Our History</h2>

          <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="Café History" />
          <p>
            Bryan's Café was founded in 2020 by Bryan Smith, a culinary
            enthusiast with a dream of creating a cozy neighborhood café.
            Inspired by his love for food and community, Bryan opened the doors
            to the café with a mission to provide a gathering place for locals.
            Starting with a small menu and a handful of loyal customers, Bryan's
            Café quickly became a favorite spot in the community. As word spread
            about our delicious offerings and warm atmosphere, the café grew,
            allowing us to expand our menu and welcome more guests. Over the
            years, we have celebrated numerous milestones, including hosting
            local events, collaborating with nearby artisans, and launching our
            own line of specialty coffee blends. Despite our growth, we remain
            committed to our core values and the community that has supported us
            from the beginning.
